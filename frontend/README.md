# dataverse-people frontend

The frontend has been written in multiple frameworks (with Bootstrap on top) and you can choose which one to deploy:

- [Web Components][] is a standard built into browsers
- [React][] is a popular UI framework

The reformat script is meant to keep the code consistent.

[Web Components]: web-components
[React]: react
